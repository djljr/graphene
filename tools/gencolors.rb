# This should generate colors for a CSS dashboard theme.
#
# Some theory:
#
# I use HSL form since it is much, much more convenient, essentially,
# to generate colors around the spectrum (or variants of color families),
# all you have to do (programmatically) is travel on a circle (divided to 360deg).
# Really like slicing a Pizza.
#
# Below I chose to generate 10 colors, which provides enough spacing on slices
# so that colors are highly contrasted yet still share a gradual rainbow theme.
#
# You might want to tweak the ordering to create a more cheerful theme for you own
# dashboard.
